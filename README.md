### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Maisoon (pronounced My-soon), and I am a senior in college. This is my personal blog/way to keep me accountable on my journey to become a designer and front-end developer.
I'm going to start actually using my GitHub more especially as a way to share class notes and side projects! 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a personal portfolio website.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Unity.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about art, design, game design, and webtoons!
- ðŸ“« Reach me via email: maisoon.rahman@case.edu
