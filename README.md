### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Maisoon (pronounced My-soon), a senior in college on a mission to become a designer and front-end developer. This GitHub is my personal blog, creative playground, and accountability tracker for all the things Iâ€™m learning and building!

âœ¨ What I'm up to:
- ðŸ”­ Currently crafting my personal portfolio website
- ðŸŒ± Learning Unity (send help... or tutorials)
- ðŸ’¬ Always down to chat about art, design, game dev, and webtoons!
- ðŸ“« Reach me @ maisoon.rahman@case.edu

Expect class notes, side projects, and lots of experimentsâ€”because why not? ðŸš€
