# Hi there 👋
I'm Maisoon (pronounced My-soon), a ~recent college grad~ blob on a mission to become a well-rounded (like a blob) software engineer. This GitHub is my project archive (both things i've started and projects dropped midway), creative playground, and accountability tracker for all the things I’m learning and building!

## ✨ What I'm up to:
- 🔭 Currently working at a startup Noya Ventures
- 🌱 Still working on designing a final final draft of my personal website 
- 💬 Always down to chat about art, design, game dev, and webtoons!
- 📫 Reach me @ maisoon.a.rahman@gamil.com

Expect notes, side projects, and lots of experiments—because why not? 🚀
